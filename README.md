# Vintri Test
Project has been built with .NET v5.0.301, .NET CORE WEBAPI.
Sorry, I could not use v4.8 because many projects are running on v5 in my laptop.
You can import solution file into your Visual Studio and run it or move to solution directory and run following commands:
  
  dotnet restore    // this will restore dependencies specified in the project.
  dotnet run        // run the project.
